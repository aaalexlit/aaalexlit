### Behind the scenes

Course FAQ Google Document and Course repo get indexed to the Pinecone vector store. Then semantic search retrieves the most similar (and hopefully most relevant) pieces to the question asked. Then this information is passed as a context to a conversational LLM to form the final answer.
