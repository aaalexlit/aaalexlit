### Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

I'm a long-time Software Developer and I'm interested in everything ML/AI

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning with DataTalks Club [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp)

# My recent projects:

- [LLM-powered Question Answering Slack bot](#llm-powered-question-answering-slack-bot)
- [End-to-end MLOps Pipeline](#end-to-end-mlops-pipeline)
- [Climate change-related news articles Scientific verification](#climate-change-related-news-articles-scientific-verification) (NLP-powered project for [Omdena](https://omdena.com/))

   
## LLM-powered Question Answering Slack bot
### to accompany the [MLOps Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp) by [DataTalksClub](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datatalks-club/)

### Behind the scenes

Course FAQ Google Document and the Course repo get indexed to the Pinecone vector store.  
Then semantic search retrieves the most similar (and hopefully most relevant) pieces to the question asked.  
Then this information is passed as a context to a conversational LLM to form the final answer.
